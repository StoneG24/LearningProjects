# List.java 
A generic linked list program that I created during a data structures class. This assignment helped me practice Java programming and learn how to use generics within Java. I was also able to practice using logic on a commonly used data structure.

# bonus_rsa
A bonus assignment from an applied cryptography course. This program takes in parts of a public key (e,n) and encrypted values, then uses the given public key values to calculate the private key. The private key is then used to decrypt the values. This assignment gave me a greater understanding of RSA encryption and how to calculate a private key. I was able to practice some other common program uses, such as taking input from a file and comparing output using the command line. I specifically implemented the decryption and naiveInverse functions. 

# bubbleteatest.go
A simple command line interface(CLI) created to be an interactive to-do list. This program uses the Bubbletea framework based on one of the examples provided. I used this program to learn some of the basic implementation of this framework, as well as develop my skills using Go. 

# rock-paper-scissors.html
A simple implementation of rock paper scissors using JS and HTML. This program helped me learn the basics of HTML and JS. I learned the basic implementation of buttons and alerts.

# TermProject.py
Implementation of algorithms based on a paper by S. Dhar, K. Pandey, M. Premalatha and G. Suganya. The paper focuses on a method of collision resolution in hash tables by using binary search trees rather than linked lists. This method is more efficient because BSTs have O(log n) for insertion and search while linked lists have O(n). This project helped me to better understand data structures BSTs, and hash tables. I was also able to practice object-oriented programming in Python.
